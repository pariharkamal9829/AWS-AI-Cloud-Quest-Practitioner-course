# Explore the Amazon Bedrock Playgrounds

## 📘 Lab Overview

This lab introduces the **Amazon Bedrock Playground**, which provides a low-code environment to interact with foundation models (FMs) from various providers such as Anthropic, AI21, and Stability AI.

---

## 🧪 Practice Lab Objectives

In this practice lab, I accomplished the following:

- ✅ Enabled foundation models using the **Amazon Bedrock Console**
- ✅ Explored and navigated two different **Amazon Bedrock playgrounds**:
  - Text Playground
  - Image Playground
- ✅ Analyzed and applied **model hyperparameters** like temperature, max tokens, top-p, etc.
- ✅ Used **Compare Mode** to evaluate the performance of **two text models** side by side.
- ✅ Generated **AI images** with different models and compared outputs to observe quality and style differences.

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Understanding how foundation models behave with different settings.
- Practical experience in prompt tuning and model comparison.
- Exposure to multi-modal AI (text + image) generation using Bedrock.
- Improved my familiarity with using **AWS AI services** via the console interface.

## 🛠️ Services Used

- **Amazon Bedrock**
- AWS Console
- Foundation Models (Claude, Titan, Stable Diffusion, etc.)
